version 1.4.3 (2014.09.08)
 * Added possibility to print help into string.
 * Added possibility to not throw exception on help printing.
 
version 1.4.2 (2013.11.22)
 * Fixed help.
 
version 1.4.1 (2013.11.15)
 * Fixed help. Now unrequired arguments are marked with [ and ].

version 1.4.0 (2013.10.21)
 * Improved help. Now help prints with fixed line length (by default 79 symbols).
   Line length can be changed.
 * Now QtMultiArg can process more than one value defined with it.
   Now user can type --arg value1, value2, value3 instead of
   --arg value1 --arg value2 --arg value3. And commas are optional.
 * Some another minor fixes.

version 1.3.0 (2013.08.11)
 * Refusal from MxxRu as build system. Now all build steps will do the qmake.
 * Review code for work with Qt 5.

version 1.2.1 (2012.05.18)
 * Reviewed code for compilation with QT_NO_CAST_FROM_ASCII macro defined.

version 1.2.0 (2012.04.25)
 * Now QtArg without value and not defined already has value QVariant( false )
 * QtMultiArg without value and not defined already has value QVariant( false )
 * QtMultiArg without value and defined already has value QVariant( true )
 * QtMultiArg with value has value QVariant( QList< QVariant< QString > > )

version 1.1.2 (2012.04.11)

 * Implemented ignore rest.
 * Implemented counter for QtMultiArg (now you can write "-v 3" insted of "-v -v -v")

version 1.1.1 (2011.04.11)

 * Bug fixing: marking of the unrequired part of the name didn't work.
 * Removed '{' and '}' before and after XOR argument in usage string.

version 1.1.0 (2011.03.28)

  * QtArgIface was expanded with new methods:
    bool isWithValue() const,
    QString longDescription() const,
    QString getUsageString( const NamesList & namesList ),
    QString getHelpString( const NamesList & namesList ).
  * Were added "USAGE" string in the help.
  * Were improved help system for the given argument as a paramter for -h,--help.
    Now you can type with prefixes -, -- or without thew, in this way searching
    will be produced for an argument name enstead of flag.
  * QtArg was expanded with new method: void setLongDescription( const QString & desc ).
    What allow to set long description of the argument for the help system.
  * QtArgCmdLineIface was expanded with new methods:
    bool isFlag( const QString & str ),
    bool isArgument( const QString & str ).
  * QtArgBaseException was expanded with new method: QString whatAsQString() const.
  * Exception QtHelpHasPrintedEx was renamed to QtArgHelpHasPrinted.
  * Now you need not explicitly add default printer to the QtArg. It's already defined.
    But if you want to set your own printer you can to do it with method:
    setPrinter( QtArgHelpPrinterIface * p ).
  * Were revised QtArgHelpPrinterIface with accordance with new help system.
    It's very important if you implement you own help systems or help printer.
  * QtRequiredArgumentUnderXORMaskEx was renamed to QtArgRequiredArgumentUnderXORMaskEx.

  Greet thanks to Pavel Lapshin and Aleksey Timofeyev for the help and ideas to this
  version of the QtArg.

version 1.0.4 (2010.10.08)

  * Correctness of the exceptions.

version 1.0.3 (2010.10.05)

  * Fixed issue #2 (If one passes "--test=1" the program crashes with a segfault).
  * Added support of flags with values without spaces ("-b5" for example).

version 1.0.2 (2010.06.01)

  * Fixed throwing exception on not required argument with option that not defined.

version 1.0.1 (2010.03.18)
