This example shows how to use visitors in the QtArg. Exactly in this example
I use visitor for implementing the argument with two parameters. For example,
argument "-a, --arg" must have two parameters:

visitor.exe --arg 1 2

Here 1 and 2 are both parameters of the "-a, --arg" argument.

Look at the code, there is all very simple. Enjoy it. Good luck.
